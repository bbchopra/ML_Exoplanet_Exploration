## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

The data is processed using machine learning models.

In this homework assignment, below steps are done:

1. Preprocessed the raw data
* Preprocess the raw dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

2. Tuned the models	
* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

3. Compared below Models for Accuracy Performance
* Model 1: SVM (supper vector machine)
* Model 2: KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
* Model 3: Sequential Model

- - -

### Evaluation of Model(s) Performance

* Model 1: SVM (supper vector machine) : Accuracy: 86.90%
 
* Model 2: KNN (K Nearest Neighbors) : Accuracy: 82.60%

* Model 3: Sequential Model : Accuracy: 86.73%

After comparing all the 3 models, the “SVM” and “Sequential Model” has the same and best accuracy.
