# Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

The data is processed using machine learning models.

In this homework assignment, below steps are done:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
* Preprocess the raw dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)	
* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)
* Model 1: SVM (supper vector machine)
* Model 2: KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
* Model 3: Sequential Model

### Evaluation of Model(s) Performance

* Model 1: SVM (supper vector machine)
Accuracy: 86.90%
 
* Model 2: KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)
Accuracy: 82.60%

* Model 3: Sequential Model
Accuracy: 86.73%
